# Healthy Food Club
The Healthy Food Club is a community that hosts cooking sessions with brief health-related lectures and introduces alternative menus to promote a healthier lifestyle.
During our activities, we strive to raise awareness about the prevalence of chemicals in our lives and their impact, specially focus on the food additives, fertilizers, pesticide, and those regulations, to monitor them for a safer society and healthier life collectively.

* The website should have a fixed footer to access anytime to see this site's SNS.  
* The website should give the user a way to contact through a form.
* The website should have breadcrumbs to let user know strong sense of place and give access to index and former pages. 
* The website should have hover interaction for links and some objects also abbreviation and tooltips with additional information to enhance user experience.
* The landing page should show what this site is offering intuitively.
* The Info page should have a variety of articles that are categorized by different perspectives.
* Burger icon is commonly used to smaller screen, so the website use this convention to represent the navigation for suit users' expectation.
* The SignUp page's submit button should be clearly visible and interact when hover it. Also changes colour and text after submit to let user knows the form was sent.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

---

Happy coding!
